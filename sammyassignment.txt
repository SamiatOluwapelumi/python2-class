DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMPILER AND INTERPRETER:
#. A COMPILER translate the entire source code in a single run while an INTERPRETER translates the entire source code line by line.
#. COMPILER consumes less time i.e it is faster than INTERPRETER.
#. COMPILER is not as flexible as the INTERPRETER.
#. in COMPILER, both syntactic and semantic error can be checked concurrently, while in INTERPRETER, only syntactic errors are checked.
#. presence of an error in COMPILER causes the whole program to be re-organised while presence of an error in INTERPRETER causes a part of the progrram to be re-organised
COMPILER converts high level language into low level language including machine language using various phases.
COMPILER is bigger in size compared to the INTERPRETER.


CATEGORIES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
1.IMPERATIVE LANGUAGE: specifies the exact steps the computer must take to complete a desired action. (e.g, procedural language,object oriented programming language,and parallel processing language)
2.DECLARATIVE LANGUAGE: specifies a desired action, but leaves the detailes of how to complete that action upto the computer


PSEUDOCODE
This is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop algorithm.
It is also a notation resembling a simplified programming language used in programming design.


FLOWCHART 
This is type of program that represent a work flow or process,
It is a diagramatic presentation of algorithn,
It is also a picture of the seperate steps ofa process in sequencial order.
